To those who plugged…

Thank you for participating in Pursuits&Alibis, a roaming hard drive that takes on the mobility, availability, and energy of you and us.

I invite you to upload, share, and embed anything and everything you choose. No downloading from this drive unless requested or collectively decided upon.

The life of this project is determined by individual participation and collective care and communication.


All I ask, frankly require…
~ Cradle and handle this drive with care and love. It is for you as it is for us.
~ Respect each artists/individuals autonomy and privacy
~ Do not sabotage persons or destroy shared content
~ Please don’t steal, but if you really really really really really have to, you must confess and give all of us an explanation to why you chose to break this chain of collective giving. This explanation MUST be published on our shared site page.

Consider,
~ the fragility of hard drives
~ 2TB storage (be mindful of your contributions -file sizes- as this is shared space)
~ the digital and physical spaces you inhabit
~ the mailing system
~ love

Explore,
    ~ care and conscientiousness
    ~ collective care
    ~ network malleability
    ~ societal slaps: when societal structures ….
    ~ citizen journalism
    ~ currents
    ~ schemes
    ~ poking holes in echo chambers


Once you have shared/uploaded, please send the hard drive along to the following artist
(mail or handoff)

Refer to the “site” for updates on the whereabouts and path of the hard drive. We are in for a passage of time with no date set. The time frame of this project is determined by each of your own paces and the capacity of space this hard drive holds. I ask for you to let go of the desires for speed and linear logic, embrace tangent with mindful intentions

Thank you, be peace, be safe, love,
